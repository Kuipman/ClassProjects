# ECE118_BOAT

Class Description:

>Technologies involved in mechatronics (intelligent electro-mechanical systems) and techniques necessary to integrate these technologies into mechatronic systems. Topics include electronics (A/D, D/A converters, opamps, filters, power devices), software program design (event-driven programming, state machine-based design), DC and stepper motors, basic sensing, and basic mechanical design (machine elements and mechanical CAD). Combines lab component of structured assignments with a large and open-ended team project. Students who enrolled in this class will learn how to solve engineering problems using the C Programming Language

This course is widely-regarded as the toughest engineering course at UC Santa Cruz, and for good reason: the demand for this course is significantly higher with fast-paced lab assignments in a variety of fields including circuit design, embedded software design, mechanical engineering and fabrication, and the capstone project for this course (designing a small autonomous robot from scratch) leverages each of these aforementioned fields. As such this course has the largest unit count at UC Santa Cruz at 10 units versus the standard 5 units.

This repository contains the software stack for the capstone robot project for this course (nicknamed "The BOAT"). For the software labs of ECE118 leading up to this project, please reference the **ece118_labs** repository.
